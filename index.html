      <header>Heading Level 1</header>
      <p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element also known as <span>"Main Heading"</span> represents the highest level of heading in a document.</p>
        <p>It serves as the main heading of a page and should represent the primary topic. 
            It should be used only once per page to indicate the main focus. 
            Search engines give significant weight to this tag, which helps them understand the main topic of the page.
             Screen readers use it as a starting point for the content.
            Typically, it is used for the main title or heading of a webpage or a major section.
             To maintain proper document structure, there should usually be only one per page.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary Title: Represents the main title of a webpage or a major section within a page,
             indicating the primary topic or purpose.
</li>
        <li>SEO Importance: Highly influential for search engine optimization (SEO), 
            as search engines use to understand the main topic of the page. Generally, 
            only one should be used per page for best practices.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section class="main-section" id="H2">
      <header>Heading Level 2</header>
      <p>The <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> element also known as <span>"Section Heading"</span> represents the second level of headings.</p>
         <p>It marks major sections within the page and can be used multiple times to divide content into significant sections. It helps search engines understand the structure and sub-topics of the content and provides a way for users with screen readers to navigate between sections. It is used for subheadings or sections under the main title.
            Headings help to divide content into major sections that fall under the main topic introduced by the main heading.</p>

        <li>Secondary Titles: Used for subheadings under the main title, breaking down content into major sections that support the main topic.</li>

      <header>Heading Level 3</header>
      <p>The <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> element also known as <span>"Subsection Headings"</span> is the third level of headings.</p>
         <p>It helps break down the content into more digestible parts.
            It further divides sections into smaller, more detailed parts.
             It can be used multiple times within sections, adding additional structure and assisting search engines in understanding more granular topics.
             It also facilitates detailed navigation within sections for screen reader users.</p>

        <li>Detailed Breakdown: Used to create subsections under headings, allowing for more detailed and specific content organization.
</li>
        <li>Enhanced Readability: Improves readability by further dividing content into manageable parts, making it easier for readers to follow.</li>

      <header>Heading Level 4</header>
        <p>The <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> element also known as <span>"Detailed Headings"</span> is the fourth level of headings, used for smaller subdivisions within sections.</p>
      <p>This is useful for creating a hierarchy within a major section.
        It adds another level of detail within subsections. It is used when there is a need to further subdivide content. Although it has less impact than higher-level tags, 
        it is still valuable for detailed content structuring.
         It contributes to a finely-grained navigation structure. 
        It helps to further organize content into smaller, more manageable parts.</p>

      <header>Heading Level 5</header>
      <p>The <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>element also known as <span>"Nested Headings"</span> represents the fifth level of headings.</p>
        <p>It helps to detail specific points or aspects within a subsection.

            It provides even more granular division within detailed sections. 
            It is used sparingly and only when necessary to further subdivide content. While it has minimal impact on SEO, 
            it is useful for detailed documents and enhances the navigational structure for users utilizing assistive technologies.
         It is used for even finer subdivisions within sections. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Finer Subdivision: Used for even more granular subdivisions within sections, useful for very detailed content.
</li>
        <li>Supporting Information: Ideal for adding additional layers of supporting information without overwhelming the primary content.</li>

      <header>Heading Level 6</header>
      <p>The <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> element also known as <span>"Lowest Level Headings"</span> represents the lowest level of headings in HTML.</p>
      <p>
        This is useful for highly detailed and complex documents. It is used for the most specific and detailed headings and is rarely used except when absolutely necessary to divide content further.
         It has the least impact on SEO but still provides some structure.
